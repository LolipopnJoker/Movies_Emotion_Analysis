## Business problem
In this project, I analyzed the correlation between emotions manifested in movies scripts and the profits from those movies. I started this project because of my huge passion to movies. But since I was a little child, I had a tendency to prefer horror movies on any other genre of movies. While some of my friends were also fond of the genre, many people don't seem to like horror movies that much. This entire subject raised a question in my head â€“ is there relationship between the emotions embodied in the movie script and its gross-profits?
## Data source

* [opensubtitles.org](https://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/subs) - I used this website in order to download all the subtitles for the movies on the list.
